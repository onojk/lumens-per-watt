## 2026-10-22 — The cumulative total is the scoreboard

- **Efficiency is judged by cumulative totals.** Watts are counted from the first operation to the last, for every test number, and summed. Lumens are the stations darkened by the end. Cumulative lumens ÷ cumulative watts is the algorithm's efficiency; its inverse is the inefficiency.
- **The running curve is the diagnostic, not the score.** Lumens plotted against cumulative watts shows *where* the watts went (steady sweep, ballast up front, scattered lucky hits), which is what you need to improve a bulb.
- **How a station goes dark.** A station s is dark once the algorithm would have caught p if p = s. This is measured by planting the secret: run on many semiprimes whose p values are spread across the stations, and record the cumulative watts each one took. It works the same way for lucky and luck-free methods.
- **Runs 1 and 2 used worst-case scoring.** Run 3 starts over on cumulative scoring, with fresh seeds, and records worst cases alongside so the two can be compared.

## 2026-10-22 — Luck by design has to pay for its prediction

- A luck-by-design card only helps when predicting a good test is cheaper than running a bad one. For Hart-style square searches a test costs 1 op, so ranking candidates (14 ops each) can't pay.
- The hit-rate column is per *test*, and what counts as a test differs by lamp (a gcd batch in rho, a square test in a square search). Compare hit rates within a lamp family, not across families.
- A gain on 12 validation numbers is a lead, not a result. Recheck on a larger fresh sample before writing it down (luck-33 shrank from 0.5 to 0.17 in log₂ on 80 numbers).

## 2026-10-22 — Small sizes pick constants; scale picks exponents

- Below about 54 bits, constants decide the winner: the Hart family's small constant beat rho. From 60 bits up, the exponent decides: rho's N^(1/4) beats the Hart family's N^(1/3), by about 5× at 78 bits.
- Evolution scored at 32–48 bits can only tune constants. To grow a better exponent, fitness has to be measured where exponents dominate: run evolution through the Rust core at 60+ bits.
- Big-number results are trusted only through `lampcore` after `parity.py` passes.
